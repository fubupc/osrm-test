# osrm-test
`/route` API service of two OSRM instance (generated from same profile and osm.pbf) give different (`duration` `distance`) result even though they are both given same start and end coordinates.

# How to test?
1. First install OSRM. (Note: default install location is `/usr/local/bin`. If your is different, please modify `OSRMRunner.OSRM_BIN_DIR` variable in `osrm.py`)
2. Open `osrm.py` and edit some variable as you like, then run it:
    ```
    python osrm.py
    ```
3. After `osrm.py` runs finish it should generate two files in `./result`  directory: `./result/t1.csv`, `./result/t2.csv` .
4. Run `compare_result.py` script to see the differences:
    ```
    python compare_result.py result/t1.csv result/t2.csv
    ```
5. Run `check_osrm_files.py` to see osrm generated files md5 diffs:
    ```
    python check_osrm_files.py tmp/t1 tmp/t2
    ```

# Some Notes
1. An OSRM instance is always return same result for same input. (only `/route` API tested.)
2. Most of input will give same result among different instance. But different pairwise instances disagree on different subset of input.
3. osm.pbf file is generated by osmosis's bounding-box extraction on [http://download.geofabrik.de/asia/indonesia-latest.osm.pbf]. (see pbf-extract.sh)
